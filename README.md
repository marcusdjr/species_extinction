>Protecting our animals is crucial for our world's environmental success, We all need to be aware of the number of animal species becoming threatened/endangered each year so that we can contribute to making a change. I have created a dashboard using tableau that visually shows each year how many species are have been added to the endangered/threatened list since 1967 all the way up to 2022.

- SQL
- Tableau
- Google Cloud

## Process

- Scraped the number of animal species threatened/endangered dating back all the way to 1967 to the current year.
- Stored it into BigQuery, then Exported this structured data into a CSV file
- creates a stopword list for wordcloud
- With CSV file, Created a Tableau dashboard for data visualization.
